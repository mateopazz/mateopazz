# ~ Hi! I'm Mateo Paz! ~

## ~ *Front-End Programmer* ~

I'm a *17 years old* ***front-end*** and a still learning ***Back-End*** web designer, full of passion for this hobby. I've worked with various projects from **secondary school** and some personal ones, and I'm very obssesed with the good-looking webs, and so, I work hard to create them.

My **primary** programming languages are:
1. HTML 🟠
2. CSS 🔵
3. Javascript 🟡

I'm **actually learning** the next Back-End languages:
1. PHP 🟣
2. Python 🐍
3. MySQL 🐬
4. Java ☕
